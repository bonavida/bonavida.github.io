One of the problems that we have when working with server-side in Next.js is that we don't have access to the API from the browser in build time. This means, we can't use localStorage, sessionStorage and a large etc. in the server.

I was facing this same problem when I was developing the [About](https://bonavida.dev/about) section in this blog. The main idea was to call to the Last.fm API once per week to retrieve my 10 top songs of the week. So, I would only call again to the API if an entire week has passed.

I tried many solutions trying to access the API, but nothing worked. Then I came up with this: **to store the data in a local cache file**.

So, I wasn't sure at first if it was going to work in production, because we're using the file system. But yeah, it does ✨✨✨.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
/** Utils */
import { hasReachedAWeek } from '@utils/date';

const TOP_TRACKS_CACHE_PATH = path.join(process.cwd(), '.tracks');

export const fetchTopTracks = async () => {
  let cachedData;
  let tracks = [];

  // Check if the data is cached
  try {
    cachedData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(TOP_TRACKS_CACHE_PATH, 'utf8') ?? null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  // If data is cached and a week has not yet passed, use cached data
  if (!hasReachedAWeek(cachedData?.updatedAt)) {
    return cachedData.data;
  }

  // If not, fetch the data from the Last.fm API and store it in the cache file
  try {
    tracks = (await getTopTracks()) || [];

    const now = new Date();

    fs.writeFileSync(
      TOP_TRACKS_CACHE_PATH,
      JSON.stringify({ updatedAt: now.getTime(), data: tracks }),
      { flag: 'w', encoding: 'utf8' }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  return tracks;
};
```

Now, anywhere we want to use the cache data, we can import it and use it inside the `getStaticProps` method:

```js
import { fetchTopTracks } from '@lib/tracks';
```

```js
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const tracks = (await fetchTopTracks()) ?? [];

  return {
    props: {
      tracks,
    },
  };
};
```
